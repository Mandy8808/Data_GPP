# Numerical Profiles:
In this repository, we present a set of numerical radial scalar profiles that are solutions of system (9) in the manuscript "[On the linear stability of nonrelativistic selfinteracting boson stars](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07998.pdf)" (Note that the temporal component is described by the harmonic ansatz Eq. (16)).
