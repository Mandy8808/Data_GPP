# Numerical Profiles:
Numerical radial scalar profiles that are solutions of system (9) in the manuscript "[On the linear stability of nonrelativistic selfinteracting boson stars](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07998.pdf)" (Note that the temporal component is described by the harmonic ansatz Eq. (16)).

Folders:
- Jupyter_Notebook_profiles: In this folder 
- Data: This folder containt two folders, "ground_state" and "first_excited_state" with the tables
